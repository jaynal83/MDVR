Mastering Data Visualization using R

A visual representation is always better than numerical summary for easy understanding. 
Data visualization is one of the most effective ways of communicating the research or analytical findings to the end users. 

The aim of this lecture series is to develop data visualization skill using R. 
Each of the session duration will be around 30 to 45 min. You will be able to interact 
with the instructor in real-time by asking questions. It would be good if you have prior exposure to using R programming.

The session delivery will be in Bangla language but the presentation slide will remain in English.
